# DragAndDrop

This is a drag and drop demo of user desktop, in this demo, you can add and delete apps to the desktop, and then 
you can also change the positions of the apps.
The number of apps displayed in the desktop is defined by 10, the width and height of the app's panel is responsive.
When the numbers is over 10, the apps will be added to the next page, and you can use the right and left arrow to change the
pages.
Also you can choose the theme you like.

Data in the demo is mocked by mock,js.

Forgive me for my poor english, O(∩_∩)O~
Just pretend that someday somebody will see this page, haha.
